# Refactor to MVC

This project has the basic RESTful resources in the `app.js` file. Split this one file up into multiple files according to the MVC framework. By the end, you should have more than just the `app.js` file _and_ all the tests should still pass!

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
1. Run the tests with `npm test`
1. Run the server in development mode with `npm run dev` or run it in production mode with `npm start`
